title: Nothing on this blog is true.
description: This is a repository of things I have worked on, studied, written, and thought about. While I make reasonable efforts to ensure accuracy, this blog and the projects posted on it are a hobby; if it was worth publishing, I might put it on arXiv. I do, however, appreciate corrections: the email domain is ortsz.com, the name is scythe+xtr, and please do not remove the plus if you are asking about this blog.

### Architecture

* Github Pages
* Jekyll
* Balzac ( http://github.com/coletownsend/balzac-for-jekyll )

### The Name
"And so on" is a repeated phrase in Kurt Vonnegut's 1973 novel *Breakfast of Champions*. It's a wonderful book, I suggest reading it.
